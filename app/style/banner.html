    <h1>GOV.UK user feedback AI prototype</h1>
    <p>Thank you for taking part in our user feedback AI research. This dashboard uses a large language model (LLM) to do semantic search and summarisation.
        It returns the most relevant feedback records and summaries based on what you've searched for.
        This is a technical prototype, it does not reflect how the end product would look and work,
        or where it would live in our Publishing Apps.</p>
